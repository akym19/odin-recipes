# odin-recipes

This is my first personal project for The Odin Project course called Odin Recipes. In this project, I will be able to demonstrate my newfound skills of HTML. Creating HTML boilerplate, the different types of elements there is in HTML, creating different pages and linking them to the index page and adding images to each recipe page.
